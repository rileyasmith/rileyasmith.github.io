## Welcome to [tungsten], my personal website project.
Tungsten is my personal website I have been working on since 22/08/2024 (dd/mm/yyyy for you Americans). The website is made as my portfolio, project archive and other relevant content about my projects. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository hosts the source code for Tungsten, which is deployed on GitHub Pages at [username.github.io](https://username.github.io/).
